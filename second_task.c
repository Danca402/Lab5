/* Task description:
First part: Stammering (or stuttering) is a speech disorder when syllables (usually the first one in the words) are unintentionally repeated. 
Look at the following ahartihifihicihiahal stahammehereher cohodehe (artificial stammerer code)
for this you are not required to use your own functions

Second part:Write a function to distinguish vowels from other letters (the function receives a character, and returns whether it is a vovel or not). 
Modify the program above to use this function in main().
For now we do not use the function many times, but we could! Please note that the program is much more readable now!
